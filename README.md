This repo is all about collecting bad domains and transcode them into usefull
clean data. This means other processes don't have to do this time after time, 
wasting CI-Runner time, on doing she same job several times to clean up data 
first.... That's about it. :smiley: :o:

These list should be updated every 4 hours at the 54 minute. This means the 
processed list should be availble around 00 minuts.
