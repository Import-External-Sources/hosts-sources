The DNS-BH project creates and maintains a listing of domains that are 
known to be used to propagate malware and spyware. This project creates 
the Bind and Windows zone files required to serve fake replies to 
localhost for any requests to these, thus preventing many spyware 
installs and reporting.

# hpHosts Classification Explanation

#### _NOTE:
Sites without a current classification are shown as "TBV" (To Be 
Verified). This means they are still awaiting classification. If you 
find a site listed without a classification, please contact me so 
it's reviewal can be sped up.
--------


The following classifications are used to determine the reason for 
inclusion into hpHosts and have been published here for those wondering 
what the classification means when viewing the domain's information 
on the hpHosts Online website.

- ATS: Ad/tracking servers
	This classification is assigned for domains being used for 
	advert or tracking purposes
- EMD: Sites engaged in malware distribution
	This classification is assigned to website's engaged in 
	the distribution of malware (e.g. adware, spyware, trojans 
	and viruses etc).
	
	Sites with this classification typically either contain 
	files (e.g. cracks, keygens, adware, spyware, trojans, viruses 
	et al) or lead to such via (for example) "fake scanners" or 
	other social engineering and misleading tactics. This includes 
	the activities of rogue Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that 
	host other sites to which the EMD classification applies.
- EXP: Sites engaged in the housing, development or distribution of 
	exploits, including but not limited to exploitation of browser, 
	software (inclusive of website software such as CMS), 
	operating system exploits aswell as those engaged in exploits 
	via social engineering. 
	
	Sites with this classification should NOT be loaded in a 
	browser AT ALL.
- FSA: Sites engaged in the selling or distribution of bogus or 
	fraudulent applications and/or provision of fraudulent services.
	
	All sites engaged in the selling or distribution of bogus or 
	fraudulent software (executable or otherwise), including sites 
	engaged in the selling or otherwise, of fraudulent services and/
	or products. This classification also covers sites involved in 
	the development, promotion or selling of, comments, likes, 
	ratings, votes or sites variations thereof, on sites such as 
	Facebook, Twitter, MyWot, Digg etc.

	websites (e.g. a chat session that is entirely scripted in the code).
