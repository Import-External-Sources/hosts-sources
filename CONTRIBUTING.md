# 2 contribute

If you feel like contributing there are a couple of ways to do this

1. You can add new super high speed bash code, optimizing existing, rewrite for 
    broader supprt of bash enviroments accross OS's
1. You can add domains to either the wildcard.list or domain.list in there 
    respective folders
1. You can throuhg **Damned** aguments try to get a domain into the whitelist
    folder

# Workflow

The workflow is a bit clumsy, but the isear is simple.
    1. You add an issue, describing your submission
    1. You then open a MR (Merge Request) where you'll add you contribution

## Why first issue then MR
The simpliest idear is often the most safe, and this is the very reason to this 
workflow. It is also giving the project a searchable database for added domains
for comment, by which we can't add in other ways, as all the lists needs to be 
raw data; from which other scripts easily can work with, without first have to 
run several cleanup processes.
